ðŸ”° Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that helps make writing styles more powerful and efficient. It adds features that donâ€™t exist in plain CSS, like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and functions. With Sass, you can keep your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain â€” especially in larger projects. In the end, Sass compiles down to regular CSS that browsers understand.
